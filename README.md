The Faculty Management System is a web application developed using Visual Studio, designed to manage faculty, students, and administrators in an educational institution. It features role-based access with user roles such as Admin, HOD, Student, and Rector, where each role is redirected to specific pages based on their access level upon sign-up. The system allows the Admin to manage all functionalities, including user and data management, while the HOD and Rector have access to specific faculty-related information, and students can view their own records and course details. Built on ASP.NET Web Forms with C# and SQL Server, this system streamlines administrative tasks and ensures efficient management of faculty and student data.
